To install, just extract the folder to a directory, and run "raex.exe". That's all there is to it for now.

What is it?
Skyrails is a social network (or any graph really) visualization system. It has a built in programming language for processing (as far as visualisation attributes goes) the graph and its attributes. The system is not only aimed at expert users though, because through the scripting languages menus can be built and the system can be used by any users.

Also, the language is pretty easy to learn. However, right now because it's just the beta of this software, there are not much documentation for the language, and hence self-learning and guessing is the only way to go. This will (hopefully) change in the future.

system requirements:
A computer with a decent graphics card. And the computer should be half decent, at least. If you don't have a half-decent graphics card, you'll get less than cool output.
