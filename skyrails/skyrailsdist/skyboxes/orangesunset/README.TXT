Skybox media copyright (c) 2004, Mark Aaron Alsip


This skybox is being provided free to the amateur game developer community in hopes of answering the very common
"where can I get free media for my games" question.

Commercial use:  permission will be granted to use the boxes commercially PROVIDED YOU CONTACT ME PRIOR TO DOING SO.  
This is not a "bait and switch".  My intent is to provide the skyboxes royalty-free for use as a background in games 
designed by others such as myself, but to prevent reselling of the media by others as part of a "skybox collection" or
similar package.  Since I still own the copyright, I'm allowed to do that...  

I am not trying to make money from the boxes, but I do not want others to make money by reselling them, or giving them away under their own name.

I'd love to hear how your using the boxes, if you do indeed use them, and I always appreciate feedback, good or bad:
